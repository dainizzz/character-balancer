# Character Balancer
## About
Character Balancer is a tool that helps users create more interesting characters by objectively evaluating the character in four areas: intelligence, physical qualties, social skills, and virtuousness. 
## How It Works
Users are given various pairs of adjectives and determine where their character falls on the spectrum between the two adjectives.
![A form. At the top of the form is a text field for character name. Below there are four categories, intelligence, physical qualties, social skills, and virtuousness. Under each category, there are pairs of adjectives with five radio buttons between them. At the bottom, there are two buttons: Evaluate Character and Reset](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/057ad9a5-45dd-46a0-9dd7-e90d45221932)
The form data is evaluated to determine how weak or strong the character is in each area, and how balanced the character is overall. This information is also displayed in a graph.
![On the left side, there are five headings: Intelligence, Physical Qualities, Social Skills, Virtuousness, and Overall. Under each heading, there is a score and rating. On the right side, there is a radar chart representation of the data.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f01fef4e-a715-4be4-a2df-25d71f01a89c)
## Future Plans
* Allow data to be saved in client-side storage
* Allow multiple characters to be evaluated and compared
